/**
 * 'Morra' is a hand game that has many variations and can be played by two or
 * more players.
 * 
 * In this variation of the game, one player is going to be the 'Odds' player
 * and the other player 'Evens'. In each round of the game, the players will
 * simultaneously 'hold out' between 1 and 10 fingers. The winner of the round
 * is decided based on the sum of fingers shown by both players. If the sum is an
 * even number, then the 'Evens' player wins; otherwise, if the sum is an odd
 * number, then the 'Odds' player wins. The winner of the round receives two
 * points.
 * 
 * In addition, the player whose number of fingers is closer to the sum,
 * receives one extra point.
